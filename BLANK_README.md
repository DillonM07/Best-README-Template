<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Frogmanian Picture][Frogmania]](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/Z7Om6fkTCVpn0VXk_q7oM0vnoHdX2VqhVnpb2_wgtc8/https/repository-images.githubusercontent.com/433945027/72500eb0-c0c6-4494-a7bf-78e74b32e149?width=500&height=250)

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email`, `email_client`, `project_title`, `project_description`

Frogmania is a game about forming your frog empire! You and your loyal subjects will assimilate more and more frogs, eventually making it a streamline production of brilliance! Tap Tap Tap away and build up your own frog regime! Dedicated to my younger brother Riker, the frog loving crazed six year old!

About Me:
I started making this game on 11/31/21 on the day after my 14TH birthday and since then it has come a long way, the first release being just the day after, 12/01/21 12:58 PM, with a couple buttons and some very primative coding. Since then I have expanded my CSS capabilites and learned a lot, I even had a day where I was at almost four hundred veiws a couple hours after my fourth pre-alpha release on Version 1.0.4 Patch Notes 12/07/21 at 8:57 AM! I hope to grow as a developer and learn a lot, don't be scarce to tell what would make it a nicer experience! I still have a long way to go until Beta but I hope with some helping hands it could be sooner! - Your Croakin' Dev, Dillon Mowry
